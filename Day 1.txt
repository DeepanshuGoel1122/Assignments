Compiler:
1.Compiler scans the whole program in one go.
2.It converts the source code into object code.
3.Main advantage of compilers is it’s execution time.
4.It does not require source code for later execution.

Interpreter:
1.Translates program one statement at a time.
2.It does not convert source code into object code instead it scans it line by line.
3.Due to interpreters being slow in executing the object code, it is preferred less.
4.It requires source code for later execution.
